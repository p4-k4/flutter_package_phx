# PHX

A proof of concept Flutter package demonstrating Phoenix/Ecto integration with Flutter apps, providing offline capabilities and sync functionality. This package serves as a foundation for studying and implementing more elegant solutions for Phoenix database integration, authentication, and other Phoenix framework benefits in Flutter applications.

## Features

- üîÑ Phoenix WebSocket client implementation
- üíæ SQLite database integration for offline data persistence
- üì° Offline operation support with automatic message queueing
- üîÅ Automatic reconnection handling
- üö¶ Connection state management
- üìä Sync state tracking
- üîå Graceful connection loss handling
- üóÉÔ∏è Ecto-powered database operations

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  phx: ^0.0.1
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```dart
import 'package:phx/phx.dart';

// Create a Phoenix client
final client = PhxClient(
  'ws://your-server/socket/websocket',
  heartbeatInterval: const Duration(seconds: 30),
);

// Initialize the sync manager with the client
final syncManager = SyncManager(
  endpoint: 'ws://your-server/socket/websocket',
  client: client,
);
await syncManager.init();
```

### Joining Channels

```dart
// Join a channel with event handlers
await syncManager.joinChannel(
  'room:123',
  handlers: {
    'new_msg': (payload) {
      print('New message: ${payload['body']}');
    },
    'user_joined': (payload) {
      print('User joined: ${payload['user']}');
    },
  },
);
```

### Pushing Events

Events are automatically queued when offline and synced when connection is restored:

```dart
// Push an event (works offline)
await syncManager.push(
  'room:123',
  'new_msg',
  {'body': 'Hello, world!'},
);
```

### Sync State Management

```dart
// Watch sync state changes
syncManager.syncStateStream.listen((state) {
  switch (state) {
    case SyncState.disconnected:
      print('Offline mode');
      break;
    case SyncState.connected:
      print('Online mode');
      break;
    case SyncState.syncing:
      print('Syncing pending changes...');
      break;
  }
});
```

### Cleanup

```dart
// Dispose when done
syncManager.dispose();
```

## Examples

The package includes two examples demonstrating offline capabilities:

### Todo Example
A full-stack todo application showcasing:
- Phoenix/Ecto backend with proper database schema and migrations
- Flutter frontend with SQLite offline storage
- Real-time sync between multiple clients
- Offline CRUD operations with automatic sync
- Channel-based communication

To run the todo example:

1. Start the Phoenix server:
```bash
cd example/phoenix_todo
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup
mix phx.server
```

2. Run the Flutter app:
```bash
cd example/flutter_todo
flutter run
```

Try:
- Creating, updating, and deleting todos while connected
- Going offline and making changes
- Reconnecting to see changes sync automatically
- Running multiple clients to see real-time updates

### Counter Example
A simpler example focusing on basic offline capabilities:

1. Start the Phoenix server:
```bash
cd example/phx_counter
mix deps.get
mix phx.server
```

2. Run the Flutter app:
```bash
cd example/flutter_counter
flutter run
```

Try:
- Incrementing while connected
- Stopping the Phoenix server
- Incrementing while offline
- Starting the server - changes sync automatically

## Development Notes

This package is a proof of concept demonstrating the possibilities of integrating Phoenix's powerful features with Flutter applications. Key areas demonstrated include:

- SQLite database integration for offline persistence
- Phoenix channel-based real-time communication
- Ecto schema and migration integration
- Offline operation handling
- Sync conflict resolution
- Real-time multi-client updates

Future development could focus on:
- More elegant database integration patterns
- Authentication and authorization
- Better error handling and conflict resolution
- Improved state management
- Simplified setup and configuration
